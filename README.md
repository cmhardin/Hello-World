# Hello-World
First time coding
Im 27 years old and I decided to stop learning biochemistry and start learning to code. I really do not know what to expect yet, but I like a challenge and I am persistant. I hear that coding can break you down and make you cry from cognitive overload. Sounds like carpe diem to me. At this point I have no idea what I am doing as I type this, but I hope a connecting thread will begin to grow. 
Cheers.
